## Portfolio Project

Welcome to my portfolio page repo. This web page project contains information about me, my skills and some of the projects I've been working on.

## Purpose of this project

This portfolio project is to create a central place for displaying my projects and abilities to others. This page itself is my first project to demonstrate my skills in HTML, CSS, SCSS and JavaScript.
