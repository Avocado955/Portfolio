## Portfolio Project

Welcome to my portfolio page repo. This web page project contains information about me, my skills and some of the projects I've been working on.

## Purpose of this project

This portfolio project is to create a central place for displaying my projects and abilities to others. This page itself is my first project to demonstrate my skills in HTML, CSS, SCSS and JavaScript.

## Current Plan for building Portfolio

- Tech skills provide apporiate infomation about the skills
- Condensed version for smaller screen which then displays options when clicked (Hamburger style or other drop down style)
- Section by Section SCSS style it fit nicely on the page in the sections
  - Making sure each section adjusts when screen size changes
